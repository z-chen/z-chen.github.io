    <p>I am a machine learning researcher who is passionate about applying AI/ML to develop novel therapeutics that extend human healthspan.</p>

   <p>I'm currently director of ML at <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com">Calico Life Sciences</a> â€” a biotech company that studies aging to
    enable people to live longer and healthier lives.</p>

   <p>At Calico, I help lead a team of AI / ML scientists and engineers, working on projects that accelerate the drug development pipeline spanning
    basic research, target identification / validation through to lead gen / opt.</p>

   <p>My current research interests are:

    <ul>
       <li>Predicting how cells will respond to genetic or chemical perturbations by applying self-supervised representation learning to high-content imaging / cellular morphology</li>
       <li>Understanding how the immune microenvironment is perturbed with aging and in cancer using graph-based models to model spatial transcriptomics / proteomics and single-cell sequencing data</li>
       <li>Enabling rapid development of therapeutic molecules and optimization for drug-like properties in various therapeutic modalities using co-folding and generative models</li>
       <li>Quantifying dimensions of age-related decline using multi-omics / high-dimensional time series data from longitudinal studies (e.g., medical imaging, metabolic markers, blood biomarkers, and wearables)
       using probabilistic graphical models</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Before Calico, I was a data scientist and engineer at <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> for 5 years.
    I got my B.S. and M.S. (in Computer Science) at Stanford where I worked
    with <a href="http://www.andrewng.org/">Andrew Ng</a> and <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/users/koller/">Daphne Koller</a> on deep learning and computational biology.</p>
    <p>I enjoy taking photographs (especially natural landscapes) and you can check out some of my photos <a href="slideshow.html">here</a>.
    I also helped start and currently work with <a href="https://pdquery.org">PDQuery</a> a non-profit that connects
    STEM experts with public defenders who need their expertise.</p>
