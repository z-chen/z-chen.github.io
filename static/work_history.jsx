	I received my B.S. (with honors and distinction) and M.S. (specializing in AI and Biocomputation) in Computer Science 
	from <a href="https://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> in 2013 and received
	the <a href="http://engineering.stanford.edu/portals/student/terman-awards/2012-2013-terman-awards">Terman award</a> for 
	academic excellence. At Stanford I also worked 
	with <a href="http://www.andrewng.org/">Andrew Ng</a> and <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/users/koller/">Daphne Koller</a> on
	deep learning and computational biology.

	I joined <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a> in 2012 as an early employee and was one of the first 2 members of 
	the analytics team. At Coursera, I built core data infrastructure including: our A/B testing platform 
	which served 100s of experiments a month, our recommendations system and data-driven content categorization / ontology,
	ETL tools for data scientists, systems for curating data analysis and more.
	I was also heavily involved in driving key decision making through the use of data including leading what
	was then the largest ever empirical study on the effectiveness of MOOCs and determinants of quality in
	online education / MOOCs.

  <p>
	Prior to Coursera, I interned at <a href="http://www.counsyl.com">Counsyl</a> where I worked on 
	improving calling algorithms for Fragile X syndrome testing.

  <p>
	Language-wise, I am fluent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Python, R, Javascript and SQL. I am somewhat competent in Matlab, C, Java, and Scala.
