	I received my B.S. (with honors and distinction) and M.S. (specializing in AI and Biocomputation) in Computer Science 
	from <a href="https://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> in 2013 and received
	the <a href="http://engineering.stanford.edu/portals/student/terman-awards/2012-2013-terman-awards">Terman award</a> for 
	academic excellence. At Stanford I also worked 
	with <a href="http://www.andrewng.org/">Andrew Ng</a> and <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/users/koller/">Daphne Koller</a> on
	deep learning and computational biology.
  </p>

  <p>
	I joined <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a> in 2012 as an early employee and was one of the founding members of 
	the data science and analytics team. At Coursera, I built core data infrastructure including: our A/B testing platform 
	which served hundreds of experiments a month, our recommendations system and data-driven content categorization / ontology,
	ETL tools for data scientists, systems for curating data analysis and more.
	I was also heavily involved in driving key decisions through the use of data including building our first user growth models,
    carrying out the largest ever empirical study on the effectiveness of MOOCs and determinants of quality in
	online education / MOOCs at that time and measuring the real-world, practical impact on users and using that to
    optimize the learner experience and course catalog.

  <p>
	Prior to Coursera, I interned at <a href="http://www.counsyl.com">Counsyl</a> where I worked on 
	improving calling algorithms for Fragile X syndrome testing.

	Language-wise, I am fluent in English and Mandarin Chinese.
    Programming languages-wise, I am fluent in Python and Javascript. I am somewhat competent in Scala, Java, C, R and Matlab.
