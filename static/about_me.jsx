export var about_me = <div>
  <p>
	I was born and raised in Singapore where I picked up my love of Computer Science and cheap, tasty food.
	In Singapore, I served in the Singapore Armed Forces as a Signals officer and was awarded the Sword of Honour 
	(best overall officer cadet in my graduating class). I enjoy cooking and travelling and I once spent a month
	training to be a safari guide with my good friend (and frequent collaborator) <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~pangwei/">Pang Wei Koh</a>.
	I also enjoy reading non-fiction, especially books on military history.
  </p>

  <p>
	I also like sharing and learning new technologies; I have a particular interest in understanding how to 
	teach better through data.
	Before starting at Stanford, Pang Wei and I planned and taught
	a collection of 14 full-day workshops introducting concepts in CS, AI, cryptography and computer networking to
	over a hundred high school students.
