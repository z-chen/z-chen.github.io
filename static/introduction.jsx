    <p>I'm an Associate Director of Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com">Calico Life Sciences</a> &mdash;
    a biotech company that studies aging to enable people to live longer and
    healthier lives. At Calico, my work focuses on building models for understanding perturbations
    to cellular state (e.g. cell morphology), spatial profiling and high-dimensional time-series analysis.</p>
    <p>My main interests are in machine learning, probabilistic models, optimization and data visualization.</p>
    <p>Before this, I was a data scientist and engineer at <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> for 5 years.
    I got my B.S. and M.S. (in Computer Science) at Stanford where I worked
    with <a href="http://www.andrewng.org/">Andrew Ng</a> and <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/users/koller/">Daphne Koller</a> on deep learning and computational biology.</p>
    <p>I enjoy taking photographs (especially natural landscapes) and you can check out some of my photos <a href="photos.html">here</a>.
    I also helped start and currently work with <a href="https://pdquery.org">PDQuery</a> a non-profit that connects
    STEM experts with public defenders who need their expertise.</p>
